Node:
JavaScript generally runs the code on the browser whereas the node allows to run website on ther server.
npm vs npx
It works for installing Modules.
For eg Angular,React
http request is send to server
Node allows to run the website on the server
node allows to run code pf js on console
When the https website request is send to server and the server response to the client and through that it displays
the content

Node.js is generally used for the database management

Eg
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.send('Hello World!');
}).listen(8080);

Req->request
res->Response
Response is send to the server and servers displays Hello World on the client-side

Running Command:
node filename.js

Modules are the libraries of the JavaScript
Many Functions is included in it

To include a module we use require()
We can also include other user-build Modules
Eg var dt = require('./module name')

createServer
http module sends a http request to the assigned server ports and gives back to the client-side

Syntax
http.createServer(function (req, res) 
Here as per above example it listens to port 8000
Req is used to send the request to the server from the client-side.


HTTP 
3)Response Writer
Response.writer(200,{Content-type:text/html})

200->Status of the http request that means all is working fine
404->Http request no received
It runs on the localhost:8000

Req has some properties url that is placed after the domain name
That can be /url

url.parse( urlString, parseQueryString, slashesDenoteHost)
urlString->It holds the url
parseQueryString ->True or False.If it is true it returns url object and if false then no url object is returned
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/project/sort=newest&lang=node.js
https->Protocol 
www.geeksforgeeks.org->Host name
project->pathname
sort=newest&lang=node.js->parameters query
& defines another parameter

end
